    Log files are stored in the `llm_logs` directory, with subdirectories for each interaction type:

    - code_generation
    - code_regeneration
    - code_evaluation
    - review_analysis
    - summary_generation

    Each log is stored as both a `.json` file (for programmatic use) and a `.txt` file (for easier reading).
